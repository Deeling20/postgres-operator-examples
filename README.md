# DMS Ops Console Utilities

This is a Tampermonkey script that adds utility features to the DMS (Database Migration Service) Ops Console. The script provides the following functionality:

    Copy Table-Mappings data: Allows the user to copy the JSON data from the "Mappings" section of the page to the clipboard.
    Convert Table-Mappings to table: Converts the JSON data from the "Mappings" section into a collapsible table format for easier viewing and analysis.
    Custom Task Settings: Compares the current task settings with the default DMS task settings and displays the differences in a modal.

The script also adds some CSS styles to enhance the appearance and usability of the added features.
